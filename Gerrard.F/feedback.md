## Python Syntax and Documentation

**Strengths:**
- **Clean, professional code** with excellent structure and organization
- **Sophisticated type hints** in constructor parameters (list[int], int)
- **Good commenting** with personality that shows understanding ("State Machine :P")
- **Proper import statements** and module organization, including appropriate use of TEACHER_FILES libraries
- **Consistent naming conventions** throughout the codebase

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Missing docstrings** for classes and methods
- Some informal comments could be more professional
- Could benefit from more detailed method documentation

**Excellent Technical Implementation:**
